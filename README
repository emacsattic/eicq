* Introduction

http://eicq.sourceforge.net/INSTALL (version 0.2.10)

This file is best viewed under XEmacs. Press C-c C-o now to
see the outline of topics. You can use XEmacs menu to
navigate and hide/show different topics. (C-c means Control
and c; M-x means Meta and x.)

I publish this package in the hope of making more people
appreciate XEmacs and Lisp.

You can contact me for anything at <youngs@xemacs.org>.

* Feature list

eicq uses version 5 protocol and it can:

- send message/url to single or multi users or group
- authorize, search, query and update meta user info
- receive contact list transfer
- register new user, change password

eicq cannot yet transfer files, chat, or anything that need
direct TCP connection. Of course, with XEmacs behind you'll
also get:

- interactive customization through XEmacs Custom widgets
- key binding, "scripting" in elisp
  (the language eicq is written in)
- send/receive multi-lingual languages (with XEmacs MULE)
- a way of life

* Installation
See the file 'INSTALL' in this directory.

There are a few mailing lists. See <http://eicq.sourceforge.net/#maillist>

Have fun!

* Faq and tips

** password

How to save password?

M-x customize-variable RET eicq-user-password
Or simply, (setq eicq-user-password "mypassword") in .emacs

** "M" vs "m" (send-message)

Commands in capital letters prompt you for aliases/uin while
those in small letters search for aliases/uin around the
cursor in eicq buffers, and perform actions on them. For
example, "m" inside an incoming message acts like a reply.

** alias vs uin

"SteveY" is my alias while "34307457" is my uin. In all prompts
of entering an icq person, you can enter either an alias or
an uin, although only alias completing read is provided. 
(Press TAB when entering an alias!)

** message/alias history

Use M-p/M-n or UP/DOWN to navigate history in prompts of
entering alias or messages.
Use M-r/M-s to search history.

** log file size

Watch out for monster eicq-log buffer size! Use M-x
eicq-log-new-file occasionally.

** hooks

If you want to customize anything fancy:

`eicq-do-message-hook'
`eicq-do-status-update-hook'

Interactive with eliza, forward messages to cell phone,
launch a bomb, or whatever you like.

** newline

How to enter new lines in minibuffer? Type "Hello",
control-Q 12 "world", to get:

Hello
world
