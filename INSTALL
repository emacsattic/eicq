========================================================================
As of the latest version, I develop and test Eicq _only_ on my system,
XEmacs 21.5.x on GNU/Linux. I use some XEmacs 20 specific code and thus
Eicq will not run in other versions of Emacs without modifications. Feel
free to test and port it in other platforms, and send me the patch.

The Windows/Cygwin port requires at least version 1.3.2 of the Cygwin
dll (http://www.cygwin.com) and shut work on every system Cygwin is
running (i.e. Win32) It was tested on Windows 2000/98SE on XEmacs
21.1.14.
========================================================================

This installation is definitely a 'no-brainer'

1) Check the Makefile, and edit anything as required.

   On Windows, check the eicq-user-install.sh script, too.
   Caveat: You must have set your HOME variable (e.g. on Windows 98 in
   your autoexec.bat, add 'set HOME=C:\' before installation. You
   should have set HOME for Cygwin anyway). Reboot if necessary before
   installing eicq!

   For Cygwin, search for '# Cygwin #' in the Makefile and
   eicq-user-install.sh  to see what you need to change to build on
   Cygwin.

   For Solaris, search for '# Solaris #' in the Makefile to see what
   you need to change to build on Solaris.

2) 'make'
3) become 'root' and then 'make install'. On Windows just type
   'make install'

Hold it, you're not finished yet...

Add the following to your ~/.emacs or ~/.xemacs/init.el
---------- cut ----------

(setq eicq-user-alias "me")
(eicq-world-update)

---------- cut ----------

As the user that will be using Eicq, fire up XEmacs and...

M-x eicq-setup RET

That will set up the needed stuff in your home directory.

Adding your own UIN:
-------------------
~/.eicq/world is the file that stores not only the UIN's of your
friends but also your own UIN.

Just edit ~/.eicq/world and change the UIN beside 'me' to reflect your
own UIN.

Of course you can change the alias ('me') of your own UIN to be whatever
you want.  But you'll have to change the (setq eicq-user-alias "...") 
line in your ~/.emacs to match.


Ok, now you're done.

'M-x eicq-login'.  There you go! Use XEmacs eicq menu to send
messages, authorize, customize... On Windows you will at least have to
customize the path to the toolbar icons!  Use the Eicq/Customize menu.
It's in the 'Option' group under 'Toolbar Directory'.  Or simply, 'M-x
eicq-customize'.  For new XEmacs users, you can press C-h t for a
tutorial on XEmacs.  Don't hesitate to message me a success report or
mail me your screenshots!
