These installation instructions only apply if you have 
downloaded the tarball from the eicq homepage.

===========================================================
As of the latest version, I develop and test eicq _only_ on
my system, XEmacs 21.1.x in GNU/Linux. I use some XEmacs 20
specific codes and thus eicq will not run in other versions
of Emacs without modifications. Feel free to test and port
it in other platforms, and send me the patch.
===========================================================

The easiest and most painless way to install eicq is with the
XEmacs package system.

	1 - *DON'T* unpack eicq-1.00-pkg.tar.gz
	2 - fire up Xemacs
	3 - M-x package-get-update-base
	    at that prompt put...
		/path/to/unpacked/eicq/here/package-index
	4 - M-x pui-list-packages
	5 - put point on the eicq line and hit RET
	6 - x (to install package)
	7 - answer yes to the question "do you want to install..."

Hold it, you're not finished yet...

Add the following to your ~/.emacs
---------- cut ----------

(require 'eicq)
(requier 'eicq-toolbar)
(setq eicq-user-alias "me")
(eicq-world-update)

---------- cut ----------

Now kill XEmacs (yes you have to kill and re-start it otherwise
the newly installed packages won't be recognised)

As the user that will be using eicq, run...

/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lib-src/eicq-user-install.sh

That will set up the needed stuff in your home directory.

Ok, now you're done.

Fire up XEmacs, run M-x eicq-login and M-x eicq-show-window. 
There you go! Use XEmacs eicq menu to send messages,
authorize, customize... For new XEmacs users, you can press
C-h t for a tutorial on Emacs. Don't hesitate to message me
a success report or mail me your screenshots!
