===========================================================
As of the latest version, I develop and test Eicq _only_ on
my system, XEmacs 21.2.x & 21.1.x in GNU/Linux. I use some 
XEmacs 20 specific codes and thus Eicq will not run in other 
versions of Emacs without modifications. Feel free to test 
and port it in other platforms, and send me the patch.
===========================================================

This installation is definitely a 'no-brainer'

1 - cd /usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages RET (or where your package
      root is)
2 - tar zxvf /path/to/eicq-x.x.x.tar.gz RET

Yeah, I know, you're swearing at me because you've already unpacked the
thing to /usr/local/src.  Well life is full of things like that... :P

Hold it, you're not finished yet...

Add the following to your ~/.emacs 
---------- cut ----------

(require 'eicq)
(require 'eicq-toolbar)
(setq eicq-user-alias "me")
(eicq-world-update)

---------- cut ----------

As the user that will be using Eicq, run...

/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lib-src/eicq-user-install.sh

That will set up the needed stuff in your home directory.

Adding your own UIN:
-------------------
~/.eicq/world is the file that stores not only the UIN's of your
friends but also your own UIN.

Just edit ~/.eicq/world and change the UIN beside 'me' to reflect your
own UIN.

Of course you can change the alias ('me') of your own UIN to be whatever
you want.  But you'll have to change the (setq eicq-user-alias "...") line
in your ~/.emacs to match.


Ok, now you're done.

Fire up XEmacs, run M-x eicq-login and M-x eicq-show-window. 
There you go! Use XEmacs eicq menu to send messages,
authorize, customize... For new XEmacs users, you can press
C-h t for a tutorial on XEmacs. Don't hesitate to message me
a success report or mail me your screenshots!
