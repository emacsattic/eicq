Literally you can put anything you like in this resource file, such as
this introduction. The only thing the eicq reader cares is keyword
":icq" at the beginning of a line. For example,

:icq 34307457 eicq
:icq 12345678 me
:icq 88888888 the queen

This way, it defines three buddies: "eicq", "me", and "the queen". It
reads alias name until the end of the line. You can customize this
behaviour with variable `eicq-world-rc-regexp'. Any other lines are
ignored. 

Adding your own UIN:

Just change "12345678 me" above to your UIN/alias.  And don't forget
to change the (setq eicq-user-alias "me") line in ~/.emacs to match.

BTW, that 1st buddy up there, (34307457 eicq), is a valid UIN, it's
mine. :-)

Remember to M-x eicq-world-update after changing this rc file.
