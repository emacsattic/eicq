Literally you can put anything you like in this resource file, such as
this introduction. The only thing the eicq reader cares is keyword
":icq" at the beginning of a line. For example,

:icq 34307457 eicq
:icq 12345678 me
:icq 88888888 the queen

This way, it defines three buddies: "eicq", "me", and "the queen". It
reads alias name until the end of the line. You can customize this
behaviour with variable `eicq-world-rc-regexp'. Any other lines are
ignored. 


Remember to M-x eicq-world-update after changing this rc file.
