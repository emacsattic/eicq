Here's a list of things I may or may not get around to putting
into Eicq.

This list is not in order of importance or any kind of order at all.
And just because something is on the list doesn't mean that it will
become part of Eicq.

Feel free to do any of these things and send a patch to
<eicq-devel@lists.sf.net>

* Todo list

** Implement ICQ version 7/8 protocol.

** Visible/invisible list.

** Direct TCP, file transfer/chat.

** Send other special types of messages.

** Pop-up/permanent window for entering long message.

** Multi-user login.

	Eicq can successfully login server using different accounts,
	and can then receive messages from both accounts.

	However, after some brief attempts, eicq cannot send
	messages with the first account after the second account is
	logged in. ICQ server perhaps checks ip address as well to
	avoid spoofing. licq seems to be able to achieve that. Is
	spoofing only allowed in TCP mode?

** Cute glyph for different statuses.

** Eliza (doctor) minor mode, auto-chatting/messaging.

	I think this would be awesome!!

** Store offline messages and send them when online.

** Security problem of `eicq-user-password' in init file.

** Openssl support.

** Port icq2tcp to other platforms

	So far we've got GNU/Linux, Cygwin, Solaris & FreeBSD

** Toolbar
	
	Move the help icon to the right hand edge of frame ala w3.

** Do something useful with the 'group' code.

	Send message to multiple contacts etc etc.

** Implement an 'oops' function.

	When you accidently send a message to the wrong person you can
	quickly do 'M-x eicq-oops', it'll prompt you for person who
	should have gotten your message, send it to him/her and at the
	same time send a "Oops sorry, that wasn't meant for you"
	message to the wrong person.  Did you follow that?  If you
	did, let me know, because I think I confused myself. :-/

** Do something about duplicate packets received.
	
	Too often you get multiple copies of messages.  This isn't a
	Eicq thang[tm], I've seen the same behaviour in other ICQ
	clients.  I'd like this one to be the first to actually do
	something about them.

** Ignore that annoying spammer!
	
	There are definitely times when you'd rather not hear what
	someone has to say. Mwuahahah!

** Triggers

        Imagine running an elisp defun whenever an Eicq message matching
	a particular regular expression comes in.  This functionality
	will need to be documented carefully due to the security 
	implications, of course.

** Externally triggered messages

	biff meets Eicq.  "Hey, you just got some email.  You better 
	read it."  Or maybe "The power is out and your UPS just kicked 
	on.".  The sky is the limit.

** PostgreSQL support

	Take advantage of XEmacs' PostgreSQL support for storing and
	retrieving all kinds of useless data about your contacts.

** X-Faces

	If someone in your contact list has an entry in BBDB with a
	'face' field display the face in the buddy buffer.

** Balloon-help style dialogs

	Move your rat over an alias in the buddy buffer and a
	balloon-help style dialog pops up containing stuff like real
	name, email, UIN etc.
